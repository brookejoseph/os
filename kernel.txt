pseudocode for kernel.asm


1. Set memory origin to 0x7C00 (this is where the BIOS loads the bootloader in memory).

2. Disable interrupts (cli).

3. Clear the AX register (set AX to 0).

4. Set the DS, ES, and SS segment registers to the value in AX (which is 0), initializing the data segment, extra segment, and stack segment to 0.

5. Set the stack pointer (SP) to 0x7C00, preparing to use memory from 0x7C00 onwards as the stack.

6. Load the VGA text buffer address 0xB8000 into the EAX register (this address corresponds to video memory for displaying characters).

7. Write the ASCII character 'B' into the first byte of the VGA text buffer (at address 0xB8000) to display the letter 'B' on the screen.

8. Write the color attribute 0x0F (which represents white text on a black background) into the second byte of the VGA text buffer.

9. Load the value from control register CR0 into the EAX register.

10. Set the protected mode bit (bit 0) in EAX by performing a bitwise OR with 1.

11. Write the updated value of EAX (with the protected mode bit set) back to control register CR0, enabling protected mode.

12. Perform a far jump to the memory address 0x1000 with code segment 0x08, transferring control to the kernel loaded at address 0x1000.

13. Switch to 32-bit mode (indicated by [bits 32]) and enter an infinite loop (labelled "hang") where the CPU halts repeatedly (hlt) and jumps back to itself (jmp hang).

14. Pad the rest of the bootloader to 510 bytes with zeros.

15. Write the boot signature 0xAA55 at the end of the 512-byte sector, which tells the BIOS this is a valid bootable disk.
